# socialmediamovements
Parses through tweets for overlap of multiple tweets from the same user using different hashtags. 
This is for a research project studying the overlaps in different social media movements, how some social movements' hashtags expectedly overlap with others (ex: #blacklivesmatter and #ericgarner), how some are disjoint from others (ex: #notallmen and #icantbreathe), and in particular how some social movements' hashtags UNEXPECTEDLY overlap with others (ex: #handsupdontshoot and #translivesmatter).
